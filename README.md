MSM model of SH2-phosphoprotein cancer networks

This repository contains source code (written in the Wolfram Language and R) for training the MSM family of models and making predictions. To get started, unpack repository in a directory of your choosing and then open one of the supplied Mathematica notebooks. The notebook instructions include information on customizing your installation.

* **learning.nb**: This notebook walks through training the MSM/D model from raw binding data.
* **prediction.nb**: This notebook walks through making predictions using the MSM/P and MSM/N models for human SH2 signaling.
* **visualization.nb**: This notebook walks through visualization of the wild type and cancer SH2-phosphoprotein networks.
